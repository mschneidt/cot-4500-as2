# Numerical Methods Interpolation Assignment

This repository contains implementations of several numerical methods for interpolation. The methods included in this project are:

- **Neville's Method**
- **Newton's Forward Method**
- **Newton's Forward Interpolation**
- **Hermite Polynomial Interpolation**
- **Cubic Spline Interpolation**

These methods are applied to approximate values of functions based on given data points, demonstrating various approaches to solving interpolation problems.

## Requirements

This project requires the following Python library:

- `numpy`

Must run "import numpy" for the code to run.
